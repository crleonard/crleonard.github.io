                           My name is Chris Leonard, and I am a Senior iOS Engineer with several years of
                           experience building, evolving, and maintaining production-scale mobile
                           applications in highly regulated environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           I specialise in native Apple platform development, with deep expertise across
                           iOS and macOS. My work focuses on clean architecture, modern Swift practices,
                           performance, and long-term maintainability. I have led platform-level
                           initiatives including SwiftUI adoption, CI/CD modernisation, and large-scale
                           codebase evolution.

                           Outside of my day-to-day role, I spend a significant amount of my free time
                           keeping up to date with new and emerging technologies, and working on personal
                           app projects such as <strong>PilotPad Pro</strong>. These projects allow me to
                           experiment, learn, and apply new ideas beyond my professional work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Alongside software engineering, I am also a rated aeroplane and helicopter
                           pilot. Aviation has strongly influenced my approach to engineering, reinforcing
                           a focus on safety, precision, reliability, and well-designed systems.

                              I have led the ongoing transition of the codebase from UIKit to SwiftUI, helping to 
                              define architectural patterns, drive adoption across the team, and ensure the migration 
                              improves long-term maintainability and development velocity.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Alongside product development, I modernised our CI/CD pipeline by spearheading the move 
                              from self-hosted GitLab runners to Xcode Cloud, improving build reliability, feedback 
                              times, and alignment with Apple’s ecosystem.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              I have also architected and planned a wider platform evolution, including modularisation 
                              of the codebase and preparation for Swift 6 adoption, laying the groundwork for work due 
                              to be delivered in the coming year.

                              Since 2015, I’ve worked as a freelance mobile developer across a broad range of projects — from personal app ideas to commercial client work. This includes utilities for developers, aviation-related tools, and health-focused apps.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              I specialise in native development for iOS and macOS using Swift and SwiftUI, with an emphasis on clean architecture, performance, and usability. Several of my apps have been released to the App Store and are used by a global audience.

                              In addition to personal and open-source projects, I’ve delivered freelance work through platforms such as <strong>Fiverr</strong> and <strong>PeoplePerHour</strong>, helping clients prototype, develop, and troubleshoot their mobile apps.

                           <p>I previously worked as a Hardware Engineer at One IT Services and Solutions via an Apprenticeship. We supported the IT within the local schools, from whiteboards, user accounts, software and networking. I gained many skills and techniques while working here, that I have since developed further.</p>
                           <p>I was responsible for managing the Staff and Student user accounts/email addresses day to day, also managing the main server infrastructure at each School assigned. From this role I received great experience in a Helpdesk environment, with both answering support calls and keeping up to date with the web Helpdesk reporting system.</p>

          <p>
            A forward thinking and hands on programme that blended foundational computer science theory with real world application. I built a strong technical base in software engineering, systems architecture, databases, and secure computing, while developing a passion for building high-quality native applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic journey sparked a long-term interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Modules such as <em>Artificial Intelligence Systems</em> and <em>AI Programming (Clojure)</em> laid the groundwork for my later AI-driven projects, where I now explore speech processing, health insights, and user-personalised automation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The course encouraged critical thinking and clean design, culminating in a final year project focused on mobile app development. This experience directly influenced my career direction and continues to shape how I approach engineering problems today - combining structured thought with curiosity-driven experimentation.

                              I have developed a simple series of lessons and introductions to help you get started with Swift. Each lesson is in the form of a Swift Playground file, simply download and then read through the code to help you get started. This includes everything from learning about variables to error handling. Once you have completed this, there is a series of sample projects to complete, this will help you put what you have learnt into practice.
